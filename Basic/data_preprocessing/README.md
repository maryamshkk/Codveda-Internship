# Task 1 – Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning

## ✅ Description
This task involved preprocessing a raw dataset to prepare it for machine learning. The steps include:

- Handling missing values (using `.dropna()`)
- Encoding categorical variables (with `pd.get_dummies`)
- Standardizing numeric features (using `StandardScaler`)
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## 📊 Dataset
A sample employee dataset (`employees.csv`) containing:
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Salary
- Department

## 🧪 Tools Used
